    "In this practice, we intend to study with a very simple model the use of radiation as a therapeutic strategy in several different scenarios. We will assume that the usual treatment schedule is 30 consecutive sessions and that the tumor only receives radiotherapy. The initial number of cells in the tumor at t = 0, time of detection is $N = 10^9$ and the maximum number that supports the tissue is $N_{max} = 3 Ã— 10^{10}$. Treatment begins seven days after diagnosis. We will assume that the patient survives as long as the tumor does not reach 70% of its maximum size.\n",
